# Audio-Visualizer
A customizable audio Visualizer written in C++. It uses a python script to analyze the current playing audio on your PC and sends the data through a memory bridge to the Visualizer

##### The Visualizer was written in my own CPU Engine called HGINE. I used five different particle systems to visualize the audio

##### You can choose between some templates for visualizing in the snd.py. Just uncomment the line below the description.

## How to use?

##### Start the Visualizer.exe and wait until you see a window.
##### Start the snd.py and play some audio on your PC!
